Welcome to my personal website! My name is Adams Y. Zhu, and I am a first-year graduate student pursuing a Master's degree at the University of Maryland, College Park. My academic interests are quite diverse, but currently, I am focused on exploring the intricacies of deep learning theory, compressive sensing, online learning, and reinforcement learning theory.

But my curiosity doesn't stop at academics. I also have a profound love for mathematics and history. If you share similar interests or would like to discuss any of these topics, I invite you to reach out. Let's connect!

A quick personal note: Although I originally come from Shandong Province, China—the cradle of Confucianism—I find myself critical of this ancient philosophy, particularly for the gender discrimination I believe it perpetuates.
